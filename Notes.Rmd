Download data from Google Docs  
========================================================
The Code.R file comes from the Guardian download of the University data.  This is also in [Guardian data](http://blog.ouseful.info/2013/06/20/datagrabbing-commonly-formatted-sheets-from-a-google-spreadsheet-guardian-2014-university-guide-data/).  This does not work with my file.  I think that is because the download of the columns needs to change to reflect the different names.  The Training.R does not work. This comes from another web site [Thebiobucket](http://thebiobucket.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/download-file-from-google-drivedocs.html).  This does not work as it does not turn this into the csv file that would be reqired.
